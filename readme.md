The goal of this project is to provide a starting base for an Svelte project styled with Bootstrap in TypeScript.
[See demo here](https://cryptic-dusk-82553.herokuapp.com/)


Features:

For development:

    npm run serve
    npm run start

## Requirements

* Node 6 or Higher
* TypeScript 2.2.2

## Dependencies

* Bootstrap
* Rollup
* TypeScript

## Goals

I needed a simple structure to support CRUD operation with JavaScript front-end and WebAPI back-end.
So I made this POC code for starting a new project with Svelte and TypeScript.
