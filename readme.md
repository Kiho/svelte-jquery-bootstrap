
# Svelte + Bootstrap + jQuery Starter project in TypeScript

The goal of this project is to provide a starting base for an Redux react project styled with Material Design Lite in TypeScript.


Features:

* Basic form validation.
* Uses react-virtualized as Grid
* CSS and SCSS compilation

## How to run
    npm install

For development:

    npm run start:local

open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8081/) in the browser

## Requirements

* Node 6 or Higher
* TypeScript 2.2.2

## Dependencies

* Svelte
* Bootstrap
* Rollup
* TypeScript

Need Babel & Express to run web server

## Goals

I needed a simple structure to support CRUD operation with JavaScript front-end and WebAPI back-end.
So I made this POC code for starting a new project with Svelte and TypeScript.

## Known Issues
